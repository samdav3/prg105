# TODO 11.1 Introduction to Inheritance
print("=" * 10, "Section 11.1 inheritance", "=" * 10)
# You are going to create a Dwelling class based on the
# Automobile sample from the chapter

# 1) Create the class Dwelling, the __init__ method should accept number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors


# 2) Add mutators for all of the data attributes (number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors)


# 3) Add accessors for all of the data attributes


# 4) Create the class SingleFamilyHome as a sub-class of Dwelling
# The __init__ method should accept number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors, garage_type, yard_size
# -- Call the __init__ of superclass Dwelling and pass the required arguments, remember to include self
# -- Initialize the garage_type and yard_size attributes

# 5) Create the mutator and accessor methods for the garage_type and yard_size attributes


# Demonstrate the SingleFamilyHome class, no need to import because you are in the same file
# 6) Create a main function.
# 7) In main, create an object from the Single_family_home class with the following information:
#            6 rooms, 1200 square feet, 1 floor, single car garage, .25 acres

# 8) Display the data using the accessor methods

# 9) Call the main function


# TODO 11.2 Polymorphism
print("=" * 10, "Section 11.2 polymorphism", "=" * 10)
# 1) Type in the mammal class from program 11-9, lines 1 - 22

# 2) Create a Mouse class as a sub-class of the mammal class following the Dog example

# 3) Create a Sheep class as a sub-class of the mammal class following the Cat Example

# 4) Follow the example in program 11-10 (no need to import, use main2 instead of main
#    because there is already a main on this page) use the Mouse and Sheep class that you created
