# TODO 12.1 simple recursion
print("=" * 10, "Section 12.1 simple recursion", "=" * 10)
# 1) Using program 12-2 as an example, create a recursive function.
#    The function should print "Hooray!" the number of times requested
#    by the parameter times_requested

# 2) Call the function with a parameter value of 5.

# TODO 12.2-12.3 problem solving with recursion
print("=" * 10, "Section 12.2-12.3 problem solving with recursion", "=" * 10)
# 1) Create a function that uses recursion to sum all of the numbers in a list.
#    The function should have only one parameter, the list of numbers
#    and it should return the sum of the list values.
# Hint: Each iteration should remove one item from the list.
# The recursion should end when all items have been removed from the list.

# 2) Call the function using the numbers list as a parameter
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
